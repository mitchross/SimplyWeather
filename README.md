# Simply Weather

A flutter project built to help understand how flutter works for mobile application development and to help figure out design patterns.<br /><br />

Currently the app is architected as follows:



## Getting Started

In order to run this application you will need to create a file with the following constants:<br /><br />


const String OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY = "";<br />
const String MAPBOX_API_KEY = "";<br />

These keys will need to be populated with keys created from the following sources (don't worry this is all free):<br />
Open Weather: https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in<br />
Map Box: https://account.mapbox.com/<br />

These API's are used to get weather and map information show in the app.
